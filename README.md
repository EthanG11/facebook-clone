In this project, I implemented a Facebook clone in Ruby on Rails. Currently supported features include posts, comments, search for other users, friends/friend requests, notifications, and a user feed.

Features currently being worked on include likes, messaging, and a user profile view. 

The Devise Gem handles user authentication and the Gravatar API is queried for user profile pictures through the Gravatastic gem.
